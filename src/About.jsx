        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p>
          <h4><span>WEB DEVELOPER</span></h4>
          Over the past few years, I've gained a lot of experience in the field of web development. I started out by teaching myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and then began building small websites and projects for friends and family. As I got more comfortable with the basics, I started to dive deeper into more complex topics like responsive design, accessibility, and server-side programming.

One of the things I enjoy most about web development is the constant learning and evolution of the field. There's always something new to learn, whether it's a new framework or library, a new approach to solving a problem, or a new web standard or best practice. I've spent countless hours reading blogs, watching tutorials, and experimenting with different tools and technologies to stay up-to-date and improve my skills.</p>

          <h4><span>PROGRAMMER</span></h4>
          As a programmer, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects across different industries and technologies. I started out learning the basics of programming languages like Java and Python in school, and then began building small projects on my own to practice and solidify my skills.

Over time, I've developed a strong foundation in software development principles like object-oriented design, data structures, and algorithms. I've also worked with various software development tools like Git, JIRA, and continuous integration and deployment tools to help streamline my workflow and improve the quality of my code.</p>
